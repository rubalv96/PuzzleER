### Use Guide
This resource can be used to create very complex applications, for this reason, we can classify the game in two different modes: Basic Game and Advanced Game.

#### Basic Game
You only need to set three parameters to build your first basic puzzle. 
- **N** and **M**. Set the dimensions of the puzzle (number of rows and columns respectively).  If you want a puzzle with 3 rows and 2 columns, you have to set N=3 and M=2 in the configuration file.
- **image_solution_face**.  Sets the directory where the solution image is located from which the pieces for the puzzle will be extracted.

As an optional but highly recommended part you can define the context of the challenge through these configuration parameters:
- **title**. To set the title of the challenge.
-  **imageBackground**. This parameter indicates the image path that will be used as background in the application.
- **opacityBackground**. This parameter allows setting the opacity of the background image to allow a better display of the image content. It takes values from 0 to 1.
- **backgroundMusic**. In this parameter you must incorporate the path of the file where the audio is relative to the background music you want to listen to while solving the challenge.
- **volume**. Thanks to this parameter you can control the global volume of the application. It takes values from 0 to 1.

Besides, it is also important to define the messages that appear when the application is started and when the challenge is solved.
##### Initial Screen
- **initialMessage** and **initialMessagePrint**. These are the messages that appear when the application is started and can be the ones related to the challenge history. initialMessagePrint will be seen only in the print view.
- **initialImage**. This is the path of the image that accompanies the initial message.

##### Final Screen
- **endMessageSuccess**. This parameter will be the message that appears when the puzzle is successfully completed.
- **endMessageFail**. This parameter will determine the message that appears when the puzzle is wrong.
- **successMusic**. This parameter indicates the path of the audio that will be played when the challenge is successfully completed.
- **failureMusic**. This parameter indicates the path of audio that will be played when the puzzle solution is not correct.

#### Configuration scheme for the Basic Game

#### Advanced Game
The application allows you to add many more gaming features. 
##### Reverse Mode
It allows us to define pieces with double sides. For this we need to activate the option **reverseMode** in the configuration file (setting it to *true*). Besides, we also need to define which is the path where the image will be used for the back side of the pieces, this will be done through the parameter **image_solution_reverse**.

##### Fake Pieces Mode
The application also allows you to define fake pieces to make the game more difficult. To do this, several parameters must be defined:
- **fake_pieces**. In this parameter you will incorporate the number of fake pieces that you want to add to the solution pieces.
- **image_fake1_face**. In this parameter the path of the image of the fake pieces is specified. More dummies can be added, for this purpose additional parameters should be added with the format **image_fake*X*_face** where the image path is specified and where *X* represents a numerical value.
If, in addition, we want the fake pieces to have double sides then we have to define the parameter **image_fake*X*_reverse** where the path of the image is specified and where *X* is a numerical value. 

##### Zoom Mode
It is possible to add a Zoom mode to be able to enlarge the pieces we want. To do this, we must activate this mode with the parameter **zoomMode** (true), and also indicate the magnification factor through **zoomFactor**.

##### Countdown timer
The application allows you to define a maximum time to solve the challenge. To do this, you must define the **time** parameter, indicating in seconds the time to finish the puzzle.

#### Configuration scheme for the Advanced Game
